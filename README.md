# wlp4-compiler
A WLP4 (subset of C) compiler written in C++ that compiles to MIPS assembly.

WLP4 is a language developed by the CS241 staff at uWaterloo, standing for "Waterloo Language Plus Pointers Plus Procedures". 
[Here is a tutorial](https://www.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs241/wlp4/WLP4tutorial.html) and [here is the formal language specification](https://www.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs241/wlp4/WLP4.html). This compiler implements a scanner (simplified maximal munch scanning algorithm), parser (SLR(1) algorithm), type checker and code generator.

Since this was a compiler written for a course, I can provide it privately if contacted at twilkhoo@uwaterloo.ca.
